# Advent_of_Code
##Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository!

Advent of Code is an annual event that challenges programmers to solve a series of puzzles in order to unlock a hidden message. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants must write code to solve the puzzle and submit the correct answer.
In this repository, you will find my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. I have solved the puzzles using the Python programming language, but you are welcome to use any language you prefer.
To get started, clone or download this repository and navigate to the directory containing the solutions. Each puzzle has its own directory, and within each directory you will find my solution code and any input files that were provided for the puzzle.
To run a solution, simply execute the code for the puzzle you want to solve. For example, if you want to run the solution for puzzle 1, you can use the following command:
